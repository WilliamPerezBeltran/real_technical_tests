# Technical Tests & Coding Challenges Repository

This repository contains a collection of **real technical tests, coding challenges, and practice exercises** that I have encountered throughout my career as a software developer.  
Some of these tests were completed and submitted, while others remain as references or practice materials for future preparation.

## Overview

The repository is organized **chronologically** and **by technology**, covering the following areas:

- **Frontend:** React, React Native, Angular, Vue.js  
- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails, Python (Django), Node.js, Java (Spring Boot)  
- **Full-Stack Challenges:** Exercises combining frontend and backend logic  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures:** JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java challenges  
- **Machine Learning & AI Tests:** Data analysis, forecasting, GPT fine-tuning, and RAG applications  
- **Miscellaneous Tests:** Company-specific assessments and online coding platforms (Codility, HackerRank, DevSkiller, etc.)

## Notes

- Each folder or file corresponds to a test or challenge. The naming generally reflects the company, year, or technology.
- Some tests were completed and submitted, while others are stored for practice or reference.
- This collection serves as a personal record of technical experiences and a resource to review common coding challenges across different technologies and companies.
