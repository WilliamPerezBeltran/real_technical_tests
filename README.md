# Pruebas para Trabajo

This repository contains a collection of real technical tests and coding challenges that I have encountered throughout my career as a software developer. Some of these tests I have completed, while others remain as references or practice exercises.

## Overview

The repository is organized chronologically and by technology, covering areas such as:

- **Frontend**: React, React Native, Angular, Vue.js
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails, Python, Node.js, Java Spring Boot
- **Full-Stack Challenges**: Coding exercises that involve both frontend and backend development
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and Java coding challenges
- **Machine Learning & AI Tests**: Specific exercises for evaluating AI/ML skills
- **Miscellaneous Tests**: Company-specific assessments and online coding platforms (Codility, HackerRank, DevSkiller, etc.)

## Notes

- Each folder or file corresponds to a test or challenge. The naming generally reflects the company, year, or technology.
- Some tests were completed and submitted, while others are stored for practice or reference.
- This collection serves as a personal record of technical experiences and a resource to review common coding challenges across different technologies and companies.

## How to Use

1. Browse through the folders to explore different challenges.
2. Open the files to see problem statements, my solutions, or reference material.
3. Use it as a study or preparation resource for technical interviews or coding exercises.
